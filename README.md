# Diabetes Progression Prediction

This project aims to predict the progression of diabetes in patients using regression analysis with Python. We use the diabetes dataset available in Scikit-Learn to explore, preprocess, and model the data. By utilizing the `LinearRegression` model, we predict disease progression and evaluate the model's performance.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to predict diabetes progression using patient data, such as age, sex, BMI, blood pressure, and other relevant metrics. The project follows these steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Training with Linear Regression
4. Model Evaluation using MSE and RÂ² Score
5. Cross-Validation
6. Results Visualization

## Dataset

We use the **Diabetes** dataset available in Scikit-Learn, which contains the following features:
- `age`: Patient's age
- `sex`: Gender of the patient
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index
- `bp`: Average blood pressure
- `s1` to `s6`: Various blood serum measurements

The target variable is a quantitative measure of diabetes progression one year after baseline.

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
